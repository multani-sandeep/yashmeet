# Biology GCSE Year 9 Topics

## 1. Cell Biology
- **Cell Structure**
  - **Eukaryotes vs Prokaryotes**:
    - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Complex cells found in animals and plants. They have a nucleus containing genetic material.
    - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Smaller, simpler cells like bacteria. They do not have a nucleus; genetic material floats in the cytoplasm (single DNA loop or plasmids).
  - **Sub-cellular Structures**:
    - **Nucleus**: Contains genetic material (DNA), controls cell activities.
    - **Cytoplasm**: Gel-like substance where chemical reactions happen.
    - **Cell Membrane**: Controls movement of substances in and out of the cell.
    - **Mitochondria**: Where aerobic respiration occurs, releasing energy.
    - **Ribosomes**: Site of protein synthesis.
    - **Cell Wall** (Plant/Algal only): Made of cellulose, strengthens the cell.
    - **Chloroplasts** (Plant only): Contains chlorophyll, absorbs light for photosynthesis.
    - **Vacuole** (Plant only): Filled with cell sap, supports the cell.
  - **Glossary**:
    - `Eukaryote`: Organism made of cells with a nucleus.
    - `Prokaryote`: Organism (like bacteria) without a nucleus.
    - `Organelle`: Specialized structure within a cell performing a specific function.

- **Cell Division (Mitosis)**
  - **Chromosomes**: Coiled DNA molecules carrying genes. found in the nucleus. Human body cells have 23 pairs.
  - **The Cell Cycle**:
    1.  **Growth**: Cell grows, increases mitochondria/ribosomes.
    2.  **DNA Replication**: DNA doubles so each new cell gets a full set.
    3.  **Mitosis**: One set of chromosomes is pulled to each end of the cell, nucleus divides.
    4.  **Division**: Cytoplasm and cell membrane divide to form two identical daughter cells.
  - **Importance**: Essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
  - **Glossary**:
    - `Mitosis`: Type of cell division resulting in two genetically identical cells.
    - `Chromosome`: Structure made of DNA that codes for characteristics.
    - `Stem Cell`: Undifferentiated cell capable of giving rise to many more cells of the same type.

- **Transport in Cells**
  - **Diffusion**: Spreading out of particles from an area of **higher** concentration to an area of **lower** concentration.
    - *Factors affecting rate*: Concentration gradient, Temperature, Surface area.
  - **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water molecules from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution through a partially permeable membrane.
  - **Active Transport**: Movement of substances from a more dilute solution to a more concentrated solution (against gradient). Requires energy from respiration.
  - **Glossary**:
    - `Diffusion`: Passive movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
    - `Osmosis`: Movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane.
    - `Active Transport`: Movement of substances against concentration gradient requiring energy.
    - `Concentration Gradient`: Difference in concentration between two areas.

## 2. Organisation
- Principles of organisation
- Animal tissues, organs, and organ systems (Digestive, Circulatory)
- Plant tissues and organ systems

## 3. Infection and Response
- **Communicable Diseases (Pathogens)**
  - **Bacteria**:
    - **Description**: Very small cells (1/100th size of body cells) that can reproduce rapidly inside your body.
    - **Mechanism**: They produce **toxins** (poisons) that damage your cells and tissues, making you feel ill.
    - **Examples**:
      - **Salmonella**: Food poisoning spread by bacteria in ingested food. Causes fever, cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea.
      - **Gonorrhoea**: Sexually transmitted disease (STD). Symptoms include yellow/green discharge and pain on urination.
  - **Fungi**:
    - **Description**: Some are single-celled; others have a body made of hyphae (thread-like structures).
    - **Mechanism**: Hyphae can grow and penetrate human skin and surface of plants, causing disease. Can produce spores forming new fungi.
    - **Examples**:
      - **Rose Black Spot**: Fungal disease in plants. Purple/black spots on leaves, turning yellow and dropping early. Affects photosynthesis.
      - **Athlete's Foot**: Fungal infection in humans causing itching/flaking skin.
  - **Glossary**:
    - `Pathogen`: Microorganism that causes disease (Bacteria, Viruses, Protists, Fungi).
    - `Toxin`: Poison produced by bacteria.
    - `Binary Fission`: Method by which bacteria reproduce (simple cell division).
- Human defence systems
- Vaccination and antibiotics
- Drug discovery

## 4. Bioenergetics
- Photosynthesis
- Respiration (Aerobic and Anaerobic)
- Metabolism

## 5. Homeostasis and Response
- Nervous system
- Hormonal coordination
- Homeostasis in action

## 6. Inheritance, Variation and Evolution
- Reproduction
- Genetics and DNA
- Evolution and Natural Selection

## 7. Ecology
- Adaptations and competition
- Ecosystems and biodiversity
