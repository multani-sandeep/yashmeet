# Biology GCSE Year 9 Topics

## Characteristics of Living Organisms `[TEST]`
All living organisms (MRSGREN):
- **Nutrition**: Require an energy/food source.
- **Respiration**: Release energy from food.
- **Excretion**: Remove metabolic waste.
- **Response**: React to surroundings.
- **Movement**: All or part of organism moves.
- **Control**: Regulate internal conditions (homeostasis).
- **Reproduction**: Produce offspring.
- **Growth**: Increase in size and develop.

## Variety of Living Organisms `[TEST]`

### Eukaryotic Organisms
- **Plants**: Multicellular; cells have chloroplasts and cellulose cell walls; store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose. Examples: maize, peas/beans.
- **Animals**: Multicellular; no chloroplasts or cell walls; nervous coordination; store carbohydrate as glycogen. Examples: humans, housefly, mosquito.
- **Fungi**: Not photosynthetic; body made of hyphae (mycelium); cell walls of **chitin**; feed by saprotrophic nutrition (extracellular digestion + absorption); store glycogen. Examples: Mucor, yeast (single-celled).
- **Protoctists**: Microscopic, single-celled. Animal-like (Amoeba) or plant-like with chloroplasts (Chlorella). Plasmodium causes malaria.

### Prokaryotic Organisms
- **Bacteria**: Single-celled; cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, plasmids; **no nucleus** — circular DNA chromosome floats in cytoplasm. Examples: Lactobacillus bulgaricus (yoghurt), Pneumococcus (pneumonia).

### Viruses (not living organisms)
- Not cells; smaller than bacteria; parasitic — reproduce only inside living cells.
- Have a **protein coat** and contain either DNA or RNA.
- Examples: tobacco mosaic virus (prevents chloroplast formation), influenza, HIV (AIDS).

### Pathogens
- A microorganism that causes disease; may be fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.

## 1. Cell Biology

### Cell Structure
- **Eukaryotes vs Prokaryotes**:
    - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Complex cells (animals, plants, fungi, protoctists). Have a nucleus containing genetic material.
    - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Smaller, simpler (bacteria). No nucleus; circular DNA chromosome + plasmids in cytoplasm.
- **Sub-cellular Structures**:
    - **Nucleus**: Contains DNA; controls cell activities.
    - **Cytoplasm**: Gel-like; site of chemical reactions.
    - **Cell Membrane**: Controls movement of substances in/out.
    - **Mitochondria**: Site of aerobic respiration; releases energy.
    - **Ribosomes**: Site of protein synthesis.
    - **Cell Wall** (plant/algal only): Cellulose; strengthens cell.
    - **Chloroplasts** (plant only): Contains chlorophyll; absorbs light for photosynthesis.
    - **Vacuole** (plant only): Filled with cell sap; supports the cell.

### Plant vs Animal Cells
| Feature | Animal | Plant |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Nucleus | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cytoplasm | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cell membrane | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mitochondria | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ribosomes | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cell wall (cellulose) | ✗ | ✓ |
| Chloroplasts | ✗ | ✓ |
| Large permanent vacuole | ✗ | ✓ |

### Cell Division (Mitosis)
- **Chromosomes**: Coiled DNA molecules carrying genes; found in nucleus. Human body cells have 23 pairs.
- **The Cell Cycle**:
    1. **Growth**: Cell grows; increases mitochondria/ribosomes.
    2. **DNA Replication**: DNA doubles so each new cell gets a full set.
    3. **Mitosis**: Chromosomes pulled to each end; nucleus divides.
    4. **Division**: Cytoplasm and membrane divide → two identical daughter cells.
- **Importance**: Growth, repair, asexual reproduction.

### Transport in Cells
- **Diffusion**: Particles spread from **high → low** concentration (passive). Affected by: concentration gradient, temperature, surface area.
- **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water across a partially permeable membrane from dilute → concentrated solution.
- **Active Transport**: Movement against concentration gradient; requires energy (respiration).

## 2. Organisation `[TEST]`

### Levels of Organisation
Organelles → Cells → Tissues → Organs → Systems

### Biological Molecules
- **Carbohydrates** (C, H, O): Large molecules made from simple sugars. Starch (plants) and glycogen (animals/fungi) are storage forms.
- **Proteins** (C, H, O, N): Made from **amino acids**.
- **Lipids** (C, H, O): Made from **fatty acids + glycerol**.

#### Food Tests
| Substance | Reagent | Positive Result |
|---|---|---|
| Glucose | Benedict's solution (heat) | Blue → brick red precipitate |
| Starch | Iodine solution | Yellow/brown → blue-black |
| Protein | Biuret reagent | Blue → purple |
| Fat | Sudan III / ethanol emulsion test | Red layer / milky emulsion |

### Enzymes
- Biological catalysts that speed up metabolic reactions without being used up.
- Have an **active site** complementary in shape to their specific substrate (lock and key model).
- **Temperature**: Rate increases up to the **optimum** (~37°C in humans). Above optimum → enzyme **denatures** (active site shape changes permanently → no longer works).
- **pH**: Extremes of pH also denature the enzyme by altering the active site shape.

### Nutrition

#### Balanced Diet
| Component | Example Sources | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Carbohydrate | Bread, rice, pasta | Energy |
| Protein | Meat, fish, eggs, legumes | Growth and repair |
| Lipid | Butter, oil, nuts | Energy storage, insulation |
| Vitamin A | Liver, dairy, carrots | Vision, immune function |
| Vitamin C | Citrus fruit, vegetables | Healthy skin/gums; immune system |
| Vitamin D | Sunlight, oily fish, dairy | Calcium absorption; bone health |
| Calcium | Dairy, leafy greens | Bone and teeth formation |
| Iron | Red meat, spinach | Haemoglobin production (O₂ transport) |
| Water | Drinks, food | Solvent; transport medium |
| Dietary fibre | Wholegrain, vegetables | Aids movement of food through gut |

- **Energy requirements vary** with: activity level, age (growing teens need more), and pregnancy.

#### The Alimentary Canal
- **Mouth**: Mechanical digestion; salivary amylase begins starch digestion.
- **Oesophagus**: Muscular tube; moves food by peristalsis.
- **Stomach**: Churns food; produces protease (pepsin) and HCl (low pH; kills bacteria).
- **Small intestine** (duodenum + ileum): Main site of digestion and absorption.
- **Large intestine** (colon + rectum): Absorbs water; forms and stores faeces.
- **Pancreas**: Produces amylase, protease, lipase → secreted into duodenum.

**Peristalsis**: Wave-like muscular contractions that push food along the gut.

#### Digestive Enzymes
| Enzyme | Substrate → Product | Produced By |
|---|---|---|
| Amylase | Starch → Maltose | Salivary glands, pancreas |
| Maltase | Maltose → Glucose | Small intestine |
| Protease | Proteins → Amino acids | Stomach, pancreas |
| Lipase | Lipids → Fatty acids + Glycerol | Pancreas |

#### Bile
- Produced by the **liver**; stored in the **gall bladder**; released into the duodenum.
- **Functions**: (1) Neutralises stomach acid → optimum pH for intestinal enzymes. (2) Emulsifies lipids → smaller droplets → greater surface area for lipase.

#### Absorption — Villi
- Small intestine wall is folded into **villi** (finger-like projections).
- Adaptations: large surface area, thin walls (one cell thick), rich blood supply, lacteals (absorb fatty acids/glycerol into lymph).

- **Communicable Diseases (Pathogens)**
    - **Bacteria**: Produce toxins damaging cells/tissues.
        - Salmonella: food poisoning (fever, cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea).
        - Gonorrhoea: STD (yellow/green discharge, pain on urination).
    - **Fungi**: Hyphae penetrate skin/plant surfaces.
        - Rose Black Spot: purple/black spots on leaves → affects photosynthesis.
