- May 1899: Left seminary (expelled as "politically unreliable")

**Ideological Formation**
- Seminary's "humiliating regime" pushed him toward revolution

### 3. His Philosophy & Ideology

**"Socialism in One Country"**
- Rejected Trotsky's theory of permanent world revolution
- Argued USSR should build socialism domestically first
- Create self-sufficient communist state independent of Western revolution

**Political Strategy**

- Famous quote: "What is extremely important is who counts the votes and how they are recorded"

- "Socialism in One Country" became official Soviet doctrine
- Increasingly ruthless as opposition mounted
