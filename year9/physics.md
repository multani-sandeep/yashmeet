# Physics Notes

## Topics

### Water Waves in Shallow Water
- **Wave Speed**: Water waves slow down as they enter shallower water.
    - Speed is dependent on depth (shallower = slower).
- **Wavelength**: As the speed decreases, the wavelength ($\lambda$) also decreases.
    - The waves "bunch up" together.
- **Frequency**: The frequency ($f$) of the waves remains **constant**.
    - Frequency is determined by the source of the wave, not the medium.
- **Wave Equation**: $v = f \lambda$
    - Since $v$ decreases and $f$ is constant, $\lambda$ must decrease.
- **Refraction**: This change in speed causes the waves to change direction (bend), a phenomenon known as refraction.
    - Waves tend to bend towards the normal (if entering a slower medium at an angle), or in the case of shorelines, refract to become parallel to the shore.

### Sound
- **Nature of Sound Waves**: Sound waves are **longitudinal waves** created by vibrating objects.
    - They consist of **compressions** (high pressure) and **rarefactions** (low pressure).
    - Sound requires a medium to travel (cannot travel through a vacuum).
- **Frequency and Pitch**: The pitch of a sound depends on its frequency.
    - **High Frequency** = High Pitch.
    - **Low Frequency** = Low Pitch.
    - Measured in **Hertz (Hz)**.
- **Amplitude and Loudness**: The loudness depends on the amplitude of the wave.
    - **Large Amplitude** = Loud Sound (more energy).
    - **Small Amplitude** = Quiet Sound.
- **Speed of Sound**: Speed varies with the medium.
    - Fastest in solids, then liquids, slowest in gases (~340 m/s in air).
    - Equation: $v = f \lambda$
- **Reflection (Echoes)**: Sound waves define reflection as bouncing off hard surfaces.
    - An **echo** is a reflected sound wave.
- **Hearing Range**: Humans can hear frequencies between **20 Hz and 20,000 Hz**.
- **Ultrasound**: Sound with frequencies **above 20,000 Hz**.
    - Used for medical scans (prenatal) and sonar.
