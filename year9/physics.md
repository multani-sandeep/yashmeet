### Water Waves in Shallow Water
- **Wave Speed**: Water waves slow down as they enter shallower water.
    - Speed is dependent on depth (shallower = slower).
- **Wavelength**: As the speed decreases, the wavelength ($\lambda$) also decreases.
    - The waves "bunch up" together.
- **Frequency**: The frequency ($f$) of the waves remains **constant**.
    - Frequency is determined by the source of the wave, not the medium.
- **Wave Equation**: $v = f \lambda$
    - Since $v$ decreases and $f$ is constant, $\lambda$ must decrease.
- **Refraction**: This change in speed causes the waves to change direction (bend), a phenomenon known as refraction.
    - Waves tend to bend towards the normal (if entering a slower medium at an angle), or in the case of shorelines, refract to become parallel to the shore.
