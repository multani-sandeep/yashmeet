# Chemistry Notes

## Topics

### Ions and Charges
- **Electrons in outer shell** determine charge.
- **> 4 electrons** needed implies a negative charge.
- **Non-metals** change endings to "-ide".
- **Ions** always have noble gas configurations (e.g., 2, 2.8, 2.8.8).
- **Metals** (including alkalis) always have positive charges; they lose electrons to become isoelectronic with noble gases.
- **Non-metals** are negatively charged; they gain electrons.
- **Group 4** elements have a +/- 4 charge.

### Ionic Bonding
- **Definition**: Strong electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions.
- **Formation**: Occurs between metals and non-metals.
    - Metals lose electrons (+ charge).
    - Non-metals gain electrons (- charge).
    - Opposite charges attract.
- **Structure**: Giant ionic 3D lattice structure with millions of ions.

### Properties of Ionic Compounds
- **Strength**: Ionic bonds are strong; significant heat energy is required to break them.
    - **Note**: Larger ionic charges produce stronger bonds (e.g., MgO requires more heat to break bonds than NaCl).
- **Conductivity**:
    - **Solid**: Cannot conduct electricity (ions are fixed in lattice).
    - **Molten/Dissolved**: Can conduct electricity (ions are free to move).
- **Brittleness**: Brittle because shifting layers brings like charges together (positive faces positive), causing repulsion that breaks the lattice.
- **Melting/Boiling Points**: High, due to strong bonds.

### Chemical Tests
- **Chlorine Gas**: Damp blue litmus paper turns red, then bleaches **WHITE**.
- **Hydrogen Gas**: Lit splint in a test tube of hydrogen makes a **squeaky pop**; no effect on litmus paper.

### Electrolysis
- Breaking down of an ionic substance using electricity.

### Reactions
- **Neutralisation**:
    - AAWS (Acid + Alkali -> Water + Salt)
    - BAWS (Base + Acid -> Water + Salt)
    - CAWCS (Carbonate + Acid -> Water + Carbon Dioxide + Salt)
- **Redox**:
    - MASH (Metal + Acid -> Salt + Hydrogen) - Reduction and Oxidation reaction.

### Salts
- Salts are always **AQUEOUS** unless they **PRECIPITATE OUT**.
