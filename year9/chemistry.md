# Chemistry Notes

## Topics

### Ions and Charges
- **Electrons in outer shell** determine charge.
- **> 4 electrons** needed implies a negative charge.
- **Non-metals** change endings to "-ide".
- **Ions** always have noble gas configurations (e.g., 2, 2.8, 2.8.8).
- **Metals** (including alkalis) always have positive charges; they lose electrons to become isoelectronic with noble gases.
- **Non-metals** are negatively charged; they gain electrons.
- **Group 4** elements have a +/- 4 charge.

### Ionic Bonding
- **Definition**: Strong electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions.
- **Formation**: Occurs between metals and non-metals.
    - Metals lose electrons (+ charge).
    - Non-metals gain electrons (- charge).
    - Opposite charges attract.
- **Structure**: Giant ionic 3D lattice structure with millions of ions.

### Properties of Ionic Compounds
- **Strength**: Ionic bonds are strong; significant heat energy is required to break them.
    - **Note**: Larger ionic charges produce stronger bonds (e.g., MgO requires more heat to break bonds than NaCl).
- **Conductivity**:
    - **Solid**: Cannot conduct electricity (ions are fixed in lattice).
    - **Molten/Dissolved**: Can conduct electricity (ions are free to move).
- **Brittleness**: Brittle because shifting layers brings like charges together (positive faces positive), causing repulsion that breaks the lattice.
- **Melting/Boiling Points**: High, due to strong bonds.

### Chemical Tests
- **Chlorine Gas**: Damp blue litmus paper turns red, then bleaches **WHITE**.
- **Hydrogen Gas**: Lit splint in a test tube of hydrogen makes a **squeaky pop**; no effect on litmus paper.

### Electrolysis
- Breaking down of an ionic substance using electricity.

### Reactions
- **Neutralisation**:
    - AAWS (Acid + Alkali -> Water + Salt)
    - BAWS (Base + Acid -> Water + Salt)
    - CAWCS (Carbonate + Acid -> Water + Carbon Dioxide + Salt)
- **Redox**:
    - MASH (Metal + Acid -> Salt + Hydrogen) - Reduction and Oxidation reaction.

### Salts
- Salts are always **AQUEOUS** unless they **PRECIPITATE OUT**.

### Metallic Bonding `[TEST]`
- **Definition**: Electrostatic force of attraction between positive metal ions (cations) and a sea of delocalised electrons.
- **Structure**: Giant metallic lattice of positive ions surrounded by free-moving delocalised electrons.
- **Properties**:
    - **Conducts electricity**: Delocalised electrons are free to move and carry charge.
    - **High melting/boiling points**: Strong metallic bonds require a lot of energy to break.
    - **Malleable/ductile**: Layers of ions can slide without breaking the bond (electrons move with them).
    - **Lustrous**: Shiny appearance.

### Groups 1 & 2 `[TEST]`

**Group 1 – Alkali Metals** (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr)
- 1 outer electron → form **+1 ions**.
- React with water: Metal + Water → Metal Hydroxide + Hydrogen.
- **Reactivity increases down the group**: Outer electron is further from nucleus, so less nuclear attraction → easier to lose.
- Stored in oil to prevent reaction with air/water.

**Group 2 – Alkaline Earth Metals** (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba)
- 2 outer electrons → form **+2 ions**.
- React with water, but less vigorously than Group 1.
- **Reactivity increases down the group** (same reason as Group 1).

### Transition Metals `[TEST]`
- Located in the **d-block**, between Groups 2 and 3.
- **Properties**:
    - High melting/boiling points and high density (except mercury – liquid at room temperature).
    - Can form **multiple ions** with different charges (e.g., Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺, Cu⁺ and Cu²⁺).
    - Form **coloured compounds** (e.g., copper compounds are blue, iron(III) compounds are orange/brown).
    - Good **catalysts** (e.g., Fe in Haber process, MnO₂ for H₂O₂ decomposition).
    - **Less reactive** than Group 1 & 2 metals.
