## Plastic Waste

### 1. The Problem with Plastic
- **Durability:** Plastics are designed to last, which means they do not break down easily in the environment (non-biodegradable).
- **Microplastics:** Larger plastics break down into tiny particles (microplastics) that enter the food chain and water supply.
- **Single-use Culture:** High reliance on disposable items (straws, bags, bottles) creates massive amounts of waste.

### 2. Impacts
- **Marine Life:** Animals (turtles, seabirds, fish) mistake plastic for food or get entangled in it.
- **Human Health:** Potential toxic chemicals leaching from waste; microplastics found in human bodies.
- **Great Pacific Garbage Patch:** Massive accumulation of floating plastic debris in the North Pacific Ocean.

### 3. Solutions ('The 3 Rs')
- **Reduce:** Minimize consumption of single-use plastics (e.g., use reusable bottles).
- **Reuse:** Use items multiple times before discarding.
- **Recycle:** Process waste materials into new products (though not all plastics are recyclable).
- **Alternatives:** Research into biodegradable plastics and plant-based alternatives.
