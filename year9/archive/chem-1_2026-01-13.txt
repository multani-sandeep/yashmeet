Electrons in outer shell = charge  

If > 4 electrons needed = negative charge  

Non-metals change to -ide ending 

Ions always have noble gas configs e.g. 2/2,8/2,8,8 etc. 

Metals always have positive charges including alkalis  

Non-metals are negatively charged 

Group 4 are +/- 4 charge  

 

Ionic bonding = Strong electrostatic force of attraction between opposite charged ions 

  

Why does ionic bonding tend to occur between metals and non-metals: 

metals lose electrons to become isoelectronic (having the same electron config.) with noble gases and for non-metals, they gain electrons. This means that metals have a positive charge and non-metals have a negative charge so they are attracted to each other 

Ionic lattice - In an ionic compound millions of ions are arranged in a giant ionic 3D lattice structure 

Ionic bonds are strong and a lot of heat energy is needed to break the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions  

Larger ionic charges produce stronger ionic bonds and so much more heat is required to break the ionic bonds in MgO than in NaCl 

Ionic compounds can't conduct electricity when solid. They can conduct electricity when molten or dissolved because the ions are free to move  

They are brittle because a layer of ions is shifted, so some positive ions are facing positive ions and same for negatives. Like charges repel so the lattice splits and breaks  

 

High melting and boiling points don’t conduct electricity when solid 

Conduct electricity when dissolved/molten  

Test for chlorine gas, damp blue litmus paper turns red, bleaches thing WHITE. 

Test for Hydrogen gas, no effect on litmus paper, lit splint in test tube full of hydrogen makes squeaky pop  

Electrolysis - breaking down of ionic substance using electricity  

 

AAWS BAWS & CAWCS are NEUTRALISATION reactions 

MASH is a REDOX reaction (reduction and oxidation reaction.) 

 

Salts are always AQUEOUS unless they PRECIPITATE OUT
