- **Same Segment:** Angles subtended by the same arc at the circumference are equal.
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Opposite angles sum to 180°.
- **Tangent-Radius:** Tangent is perpendicular (90°) to the radius at the point of contact.
- **Two Tangents:** Tangents from the same external point to the circle are equal in length.
- **Alternate Segment:** Angle between tangent and chord equals angle in the alternate segment.
